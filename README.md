## Project Overview ðŸ’—
This project is inspired by the concept of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock game from the Big Bang Theory sitcom. I made this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a rock, paper, and scissors at first, but then I remembered about the episode that I used to watch on TBBT, so I created this fun game for you to play against SHELDON! (get it? 'cause he's a robot ;-;). Anyways, please enjoy the game.
